To use the P3M-10K dataset from Kaggle in Google Colab, follow these steps:

Step 1: Get Kaggle API Key
Go to Kaggle and log in.

Click on your profile picture (top-right) â†’ Account.

Scroll down to the API section and click Create New API Token.

A file named kaggle.json will be downloaded.

Step 2: Upload kaggle.json to Colab
Open a new Google Colab notebook.

Run the following code to upload your kaggle.json file:


from google.colab import files
files.upload()  # Upload the kaggle.json file
Step 3: Set Up Kaggle API in Colab
Run the following commands to move kaggle.json to the correct directory and set permissions:


import os
!mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
!mv kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
!chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
Step 4: Download the P3M-10K Dataset
Use the following command to download the dataset:


!kaggle datasets download -d rahulbhalley/p3m-10k
This will download a .zip file containing the dataset.

Step 5: Extract the Dataset
Extract the dataset using:


import zipfile

dataset_zip = "p3m-10k.zip"  # Change filename if needed
with zipfile.ZipFile(dataset_zip, "r") as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall("P3M-10K")  # Extract to a folder
Now, all dataset files are stored in the P3M-10K/ directory.

Step 6: Verify Dataset Files
To check the extracted files:

import os
os.listdir("P3M-10K")
Step 7: Load Images or CSV Files
If the dataset contains images, you can view them using:

import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

img_path = "P3M-10K/sample_image.jpg"  # Change to an actual image path
img = cv2.imread(img_path)
img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

plt.imshow(img)
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()
If the dataset has CSV files, load them using:

import pandas as pd

csv_path = "P3M-10K/sample.csv"  # Change to actual CSV filename
df = pd.read_csv(csv_path)
df.head()
This setup allows you to easily use the P3M-10K dataset in Google Colab. Let me know if you need further assistance! ðŸš€
